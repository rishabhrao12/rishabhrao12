Hey 👋🏻, I'm Rishabh Rao, a fourth-year engineering student. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science. I'm currently interning at a research lab in Data Science. I am proficient in python and currently learning deep learning.

Apart from my work, I enjoy listening to music 🎧, going to the gym 🏋🏻 and reading books.

“Most of the good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” — Linus Torvalds

I am currently creating a repository for deep learning called neural nets, encompassing the various topics of deep learning along with their applications, breaking the architectures down into their components, and visualizing their learnings to help understand the concepts from the ground up.
