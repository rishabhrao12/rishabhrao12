Hey 👋🏻, I'm Rishabh Rao, a fourth-year engineering student. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science. I'm currently interning at a research lab in Data Science. I am proficient in Python and I'm in the process of learning deep learning.

Apart from my work, I enjoy listening to music 🎧, going to the gym 🏋🏻 and reading books.

I am creating a repository for deep learning called neural nets, encompassing the various topics of deep learning along with their applications, breaking the architectures down into their components, and visualizing their learnings to help understand the concepts from the ground up.
